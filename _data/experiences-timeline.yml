  description: Extended the vector module of sympy to support the integration of scalar/vector fields over Curves, Surfaces and Volumes.
  courses:
    - Added classes to represent parametric and implicit regions. 
    - Implemented the algorithm to obtain rational parametrization of implicit regions.
    - Added classes to represent Integral of scalar/vector field over different regions.
    - Completed the documentation and testing of new features.

  description: Worked on SHAKTI project under Professor V. Kamakoti. RISE lab is the birthplace of SHAKTI microprocessor series, India's first indigenous microprocessor. SHAKTI microprocessor use RISCV Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), a simple and open ISA.
  courses:
    - Modified GCC for RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture to detect floating-point exceptions.
    - New assembly instructions were added after every floating-point operation to check for any IEEE floating point exception.
